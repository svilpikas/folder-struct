        <h2>Dynamic folder application</h2>
        <h3>Functional requirements</h3>
        <p>Create a responsive design WEB application for dynamic creation and representation of hierarchical
            folder structure.</p>
        <p>The program should enable user to create a new child folders and specify names for them.</p>
        <p>The program should allow user to navigate to each folder and view all it’s child folders.</p>
        <p>The program should always display user’s location in folder structure.</p>
        <p>Every folder can have unlimited number of child folders.</p>
        <p>The depth of folder structure is also not limited.</p>
        <h3>Non-functional requirements</h3>
        <p>The work should demonstrate your ability to create an intuitive, user friendly, modern looking web
            user interface.</p>
        <p>The program should illustrate your mastership on selected technologies and frameworks.</p>
        <p>We expect technical design choices to be based on best industry practices.</p>
        <h3>Tooling requirements</h3>
        <p>For the solution we expect Front End technologies and frameworks to be used like: AngularJS,
            JavaScript, etc...</p>
        <h3>Documentation requirements</h3>
        <p>Together with your solution, please provide a very brief documentation. Documentation should
            provide following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>1. Short description how to run/use your application</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>2. Explanation of your choices (frameworks, libraries, architecture...)</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
